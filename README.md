# Advent of Code 2023 in Haskell

If you are interested in `Go`, then you should definitely check out [aszalosl's repo](https://github.com/aszalosl/aoc2023)!

## Briefing

Team Red will do fluent interface pattern, and will fight towards the end:

```javascript
const f = (xs) => xs.map(beginning).filter(middle).map(end)
```

Team Blue will do function composition, and will fight towards the beginning:

```haskell
f = map end . filter middle . map beginning
```

You are part of [Team Blue](https://youtu.be/ash8vDNcJBs?t=60).

## Briefing for that one single specific person

I don't think you want to be in any of those teams.

So, just go to [Amalfi](https://youtu.be/CDb6seqyKsI?t=14), swim a little, enjoy the food, draw the buildings, read some books from your bucket list, you know.

Heck, I think we both know someone who could even give you some tips on diving if you feel adventurous.
